weiqi
=====

Weiqi (also called Go) is a popular board game originated in China.  This project is to create one or more Lazarus components for the game.  Anyone can use it to create his/her own weiqi programs, under the GNU LGPL 3.0 license.

This project is just started by Gui Yan-Zhong and the initial commit is still far from feature complete.
